Database setup: https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/MySQL_HowTo.html

When you change from your temporary password, set the new password to 'password' for the spring boot application to work.

When you launch the mysql database server, you can access it via MySql Workbench app client.
For the Spring Boot code to work, you need to create a database inside the root user with the name 'eshop'.
  - To do this, just run the script: 'CREATE DATABSE eshop'
